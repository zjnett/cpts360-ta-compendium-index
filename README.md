# CptS 360 TA Compendium Index Page
This is a repository dedicated to the hosting of the "index" page of the CS360 TA compendium, as well as announcements.

The primary reason for this is because hyperlinks exported from Notion must be fixed to point to the proper .html file on the web server. Having this git repository means that changes to the document may simply be merged using git, allowing new additions to be accepted while old hyperlinks changes are retained.
